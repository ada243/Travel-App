## Challenges and Success

### Successes
- Happy to have something deployed and functioning
- Gained a more solid understand of how API calls work - primarily with respect to the returned JSON object and how JavaScript can run asynchronously using ajax and the .then() method when getting data returned from the api and then running some function after the data is received.
- The ability to add some styling using a CCS framework
- Also, very happy to FINALLY understand how to write markdown (lol).

### Challenges

- My hardest challenge was the beginning - thinking of an idea.
- My second hardest challenge was creating an *efficient* plan to excute said idea.
- I did not realize how unfamiliar it would be to use a CSS framework, in this case Materialize. For some reason I had a hard time wrapping the idea around my head. While I understand what I have written thus far, I can tell that I will require much practice in the future to fully understand styling concepts.

## What's Next?

### For the App
- Styling 
  - I would like to clean up the styling. While I do not expect this to be a full webpage, I would like to display the content better and be more responsive. I also believe the accessibility is extremely important so I would like to apply more accessibility measures as well.
- Search-bar 
  - I would like to have the destinations and time captured in natural language instead of using IATA codes etc!

### For Myself
- While I do have far to go, this was still my first app that I have built from scratch so I am happy with this. Moving forward, I would like to learn how to add more functionality and interaction to my web applications. I believe more practice with JQuery is in my  future.
